For piece coordinates, starting with green front and white top (x,y,z)
first digit X reperesents column from front left to right
second digit z represents row from front bottom to top          
third digit y represents layer from back to front

back bottom left is 0,0,0
core is 1,1,1
top front right is 2,2,2

get_piece returns the piece as a string from position x,y,z.
If x is 0 or 2 the first letter will be what is on either the left or right faces
If x is 1 then there will only be maximum two letters because in the core column

If numbers contains only 0s or 2s its a corner.
If contains one 1 its a edge
If it has multiple 1s its a center piece
