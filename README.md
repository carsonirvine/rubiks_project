# rubiks\_project

Uses the magiccube python library, https://github.com/trincaog/magiccube. 

Solves a 3x3 rubiks cube using the Old Pochmann Method. It creates 
or takes in a scramble for a 3x3 rubiks cube with green on the front 
side and white on the top side and computes the edge and corner letter
sequence, as well as whether you need to do the Ra perm parity algorithm
