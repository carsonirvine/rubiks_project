# 3x3 Blind Solver

Uses the magiccube python library, https://github.com/trincaog/magiccube,
to initially scramble and then keep track of cube state.

Solves a 3x3 rubiks cube using the Old Pochmann Method. It creates
or takes in a scramble for a 3x3 rubiks cube with green on the front
side and white on the top side and computes the edge and corner letter
sequence, as well as whether you need to do the Ra perm parity algorithm.



To use clone repository and navigate to it in the terminal. Launch the webpage

by running "$ python3 website.py" and then enter the development server address

into your browser. Typically "http://127.0.0.1:5000". 



Webpage instructions:

1\.	Select whether you would like to receive the edge sequence, corner 

&nbsp;	sequence, or both (including parity).



2\.	Input your scramble, or if you want a random scramble leave the

&nbsp;	input box empty



3\.	Press solve
